# Node.js Overview

Node.js allows us to run JavaScript outside the browser.  

It is built using the **V8 JavaScript engine** and a **C++ runtime**, forming what is now called a **JavaScript runtime environment**.

## What Can You Build with Node.js?
Node.js is versatile and can be used to build:
- Web servers
- CLI (Command Line Interface) tools
- iOS and Android apps
- IoT applications
- Smartwatch apps

## Versions
- **LTS (Long Term Support):** Stable versions for production
- **Current:** Latest features, often used for experimentation  
  *(Even numbers → LTS, Odd numbers → Current)*

## Package Management
- **npm (Node Package Manager):** Used to install and manage dependencies in Node.js projects

## Node CLI
Node.js comes with a Command Line Interface (CLI) that allows you to:
- Check Node.js version: `node -v`
- Run scripts in watch mode
- Explore many other options

## Node.js vs JavaScript in Browser
JavaScript features provided by browsers may not work in Node.js, since Node.js is a runtime outside the browser environment.
